# tclog - Twitch Chat Logger

`tclog` is a console application to log [Twitch](https://twitch.tv) chats.

This project is still in its infancy. I'm hoping to get feedback from people using it.

If you spot any bugs or have features that you'd really like to see in `tclog`, please submit [an issue](https://github.com/tclog/tclog/issues).

This project is maintained by [tastyfriedtofu](https://twitch.tv/tastyfriedtofu).

## Usage

Join a channel as an anonymous user and log every messages to `./tclog_[channel]_[yyyy-mm-dd].log`.

```bash
tclog [channel]
```

The log use JSON for structured logging.

That's it, for now. I will add more functionality and configurations little by little.

### Build from source

I use [goreleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) to build this project on my local workstation. I am too lazy to write a Makefile. If you want to, please submit a PR. 

1. [Install goreleaser](https://goreleaser.com/install/)
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/tclog/tclog && cd tclog`
2. Build the project: `goreleaser --snapshot --skip-publish --rm-dist`
3. Look for `./dist` directory for the built binaries
4. Move the resulting binary executable to somewhere in your PATH
5. Run `tclog` to check if it worked.
